# Vulnerability-Scanner-and-Management-Platform
This project aims to create a comprehensive vulnerability scanner and management platform that assists organizations in identifying, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities across their infrastructure and applications.

Description:
This project aims to create a comprehensive vulnerability scanner and management platform that assists organizations in identifying, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities across their infrastructure and applications. The platform will provide features such as automated vulnerability scanning, risk assessment, vulnerability tracking, and reporting functionalities.

Features:
Integration with vulnerability databases and feeds (e.g., CVE, NVD) for up-to-date vulnerability information.
Automated vulnerability scanning of network devices, servers, and applications.
Risk assessment and prioritization of vulnerabilities based on severity, impact, and exploitability.
Vulnerability tracking and management with ticketing system integration (e.g., JIRA, ServiceNow).
Remediation workflow management and assignment of tasks to responsible teams.
Real-time dashboard and reporting capabilities for monitoring vulnerability trends and metrics.
Customizable policies and compliance checks to ensure adherence to security standards (e.g., CIS benchmarks).
Technologies Used:
Python (for backend logic)
Flask (for web application framework)
Elasticsearch (for storing and querying vulnerability data)
Kibana (for visualization and dashboarding)
Docker (for containerization)
Integration with vulnerability scanners and ticketing systems' APIs (e.g., Nessus, Qualys, JIRA)
How to run the project:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Docker if you haven't already.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run Docker Compose to build and start the containers: docker-compose up --build
Access the web application interface in your browser (typically http://localhost:5000).
Configure integrations with your existing vulnerability scanners and ticketing systems.
